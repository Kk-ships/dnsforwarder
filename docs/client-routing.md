# Client-Based DNS Routing

The DNS forwarder supports intelligent client-based routing, allowing you to direct different clients to different upstream DNS servers. This is perfect for scenarios where you want:

- **Private DNS servers** (like PiHole or AdGuard Home) for most devices
- **Public DNS servers** (like Cloudflare or Google) as fallback or for specific devices
- **Centralized management** without touching individual device network settings

## How It Works

1. **Default Behavior (`ENABLE_CLIENT_ROUTING=false`):**
   - All clients use the same upstream servers defined in `PRIVATE_DNS_SERVERS` first
     and `PUBLIC_DNS_SERVERS` as fallback.

2. **Client Routing Enabled (`ENABLE_CLIENT_ROUTING=true`):**
   - Most clients use `PRIVATE_DNS_SERVERS` first, with `PUBLIC_DNS_SERVERS` as fallback.
   - Clients listed in `PUBLIC_ONLY_CLIENTS` (by IP) or `PUBLIC_ONLY_CLIENT_MACS` (by MAC address) use only `PUBLIC_DNS_SERVERS`.
   - Health checks ensure only reachable servers are used.

## MAC Address-Based Routing

If your network uses DHCP and client IPs change frequently, you can use MAC addresses to identify clients that should always use public DNS servers (bypassing ad-blocking, etc). This is similar to how Pi-hole can whitelist by MAC address.

Set the `PUBLIC_ONLY_CLIENT_MACS` environment variable to a comma-separated list of MAC addresses (e.g., `00:11:22:33:44:55,AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`). The DNS forwarder will attempt to resolve the MAC address for each client IP using the ARP table. If a match is found, that client will be routed to public DNS servers only, regardless of its current IP address.

**Note:** MAC address detection works only for clients on the same local network segment as the DNS forwarder (LAN). It will not work for remote clients or across routers.

## Example `.env` Configuration

```
ENABLE_CLIENT_ROUTING=true
PUBLIC_ONLY_CLIENTS=192.168.1.100,10.0.0.50
PUBLIC_ONLY_CLIENT_MACS=00:11:22:33:44:55,AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
```

## Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: PiHole with Public Fallback**
```bash
ENABLE_CLIENT_ROUTING=true
PRIVATE_DNS_SERVERS=192.168.1.10:53    # Your PiHole
PUBLIC_DNS_SERVERS=1.1.1.1:53,8.8.8.8:53
PUBLIC_ONLY_CLIENTS=192.168.1.100      # Problematic device (by IP)
PUBLIC_ONLY_CLIENT_MACS=00:11:22:33:44:55 # Problematic device (by MAC)
```

**Scenario 2: Multiple Private Servers**
```bash
ENABLE_CLIENT_ROUTING=true
PRIVATE_DNS_SERVERS=192.168.1.10:53,192.168.1.11:53  # PiHole + AdGuard
PUBLIC_DNS_SERVERS=1.1.1.1:53,9.9.9.9:53
PUBLIC_ONLY_CLIENTS=192.168.1.100,10.0.0.50          # Testing devices (by IP)
PUBLIC_ONLY_CLIENT_MACS=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF             # Testing device (by MAC)
```

**Scenario 3: Corporate Environment**
```bash
ENABLE_CLIENT_ROUTING=true
PRIVATE_DNS_SERVERS=10.10.1.1:53,10.10.1.2:53       # Internal DNS
PUBLIC_DNS_SERVERS=8.8.8.8:53,1.1.1.1:53
PUBLIC_ONLY_CLIENTS=10.10.2.100,10.10.2.101         # Guest network devices (by IP)
PUBLIC_ONLY_CLIENT_MACS=11:22:33:44:55:66           # Guest device (by MAC)
```

## Benefits
- **Centralized Control:** Change DNS behavior without touching individual devices
- **Flexibility:** Easy to test different configurations or troubleshoot problematic devices
- **Reliability:** Automatic fallback ensures DNS always works
- **Performance:** Private servers first, public as backup
- **Monitoring:** All DNS routing decisions are logged and can be monitored via Prometheus metrics
